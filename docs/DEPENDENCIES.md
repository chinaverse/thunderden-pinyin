# Dependencies

Authoritative source versions and hashes are in the repository's `.env` file.
The build uses Bitcoin Core 31.1 and a digest/snapshot-pinned Debian 13.6 build
environment. The pinned Debian multi-architecture index lets Docker use native
build tools on AMD64 and ARM64 hosts. Buildroot supplies the x86-64 image toolchain,
runtime libraries, Linux, BusyBox and GRUB.

## Runtime components

| Component | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Bitcoin Core internal libraries | BIP32, keys, descriptors/Miniscript, PSBTs, signing/script verification, hashes and serialization |
| Core's bundled libsecp256k1 | Elliptic-curve operations |
| OpenSSL libcrypto | BIP39 PBKDF2 and constant-time comparison |
| BIP39 English wordlist | Standard recovery-word data |
| BIP39 Chinese (Simplified) wordlist | Chinese recovery words, mapped by index to English words |
| `src/chinese_pinyin.txt` | Toneless pinyin for each Chinese word (generated with pypinyin 0.55.0); selects input candidates only |
| GNU Unifont 16.0.04 (OFL-1.1) | 16x16 bitmaps of the 2048 Chinese words, compiled into the signer |
| C/C++ runtime | Allocation, standard containers and operating-system interfaces |
| bc-ur reference implementation | UR v2 Bytewords and fountain encoding/decoding |
| ZBar 0.23.93 | QR recognition in grayscale camera images |
| libqrencode 4.1.1 | QR module generation |
| libv4l 1.28.1 and JPEG library | Webcam capture and common image-format conversion |

Core is built from unmodified source. Its internal archives are build artifacts,
not a shared wallet SDK. Linker garbage collection removes unused code. The native
signing test executable links libcrypto and the standard C/C++ runtime libraries;
selected node, RPC, wallet and LevelDB symbols are absent. The node/wallet/LevelDB
archives are not built.

Core's shared descriptor/signing implementation retains MuSig helpers even though
Thunder Den rejects MuSig policies and PSBT input metadata. Core RNG, secure
allocation, logging and filesystem-support code also remain dependencies. Runtime
checks of the signing tests observe system-metadata reads and local NETLINK_ROUTE
queries, no IP sockets or filesystem-write opens and successful signing with socket
creation unavailable. These checks cover the exercised library paths. A complete
packed-initramfs inventory is emitted as `installed-files.json`. The native runtime
check inspects the development signer/scanner symbols and shared-library dependencies
and reports their stripped executable sizes.

## QR and camera configuration

ZBar and libqrencode use C APIs that accept/produce image data directly and require
no desktop framework. ZBar is built with QR symbology only, without its video
frontend, JPEG converter, GUI bindings, DBus or language bindings. libqrencode is
built without its tools or PNG support.
The checked development builds of these two libraries depend only on libc.

libv4l handles webcam negotiation and conversion, including normal MJPEG cameras.
Its optional plugins, wrappers and utility programs are disabled. The checked
capture-library closure consists of libv4l2, libv4lconvert, libjpeg, libc and libm.
The image targets standard UVC webcams, including typical integrated laptop cameras.
Physical camera compatibility still requires hardware tests.

ZBar, libv4l and JPEG decoding run in `thunderden-scanner`; these libraries are
absent from the signing executable's dependencies. Scanner confinement uses the
pinned Linux kernel's Landlock API directly. See [Scanner isolation](ISOLATION.md)
for the threat model, boundary and compatibility requirements.

bc-ur is pinned by commit and archive hash. The adapter validates URI fields,
unsigned CBOR lengths, fragment geometry, stream identity and work limits before
passing a constructed part to its fountain decoder. Upstream's generic CBOR byte
decoder is not used for scanned lengths. Two missing transitive standard-header
includes are supplied by compiler options; the source is unmodified. Its bundled
CRC/SHA and deterministic fountain-mixing code processes public transport data.
Bitcoin key derivation and signing remain Core operations. BBQR is not implemented.

## Development

Docker supplies the compiler, CMake, Python test runner, binary inspection tools
and source downloads. These tools are not installed in the signer image.
The independent `urtypes` 1.0.1 registry codec is hash-pinned for export-compatibility
tests only. Debian's development libcrypto also links zlib/zstd; this does not add
BBQR support. The image builds its own dependency configuration through Buildroot.

## Trust boundary

An AI-assisted audit can start with Thunder Den's code, build settings and use of
dependencies. Linux, Bitcoin Core, OpenSSL, the camera/QR libraries, the toolchain
and hardware/firmware still need to be reviewed or trusted. Pinned sources and
reproducible builds help you check which code goes into the image.
