# Thunder Den

**Turn a spare laptop into an airgapped Bitcoin signer.**

Thunder Den's image boots from USB and runs in memory. Import your existing
recovery words, review transactions on the laptop and exchange data through QR
codes.

Thunder Den is designed so you can use AI to check its claims against the code
before you use it. Its own signer and scanner code, build scripts, boot settings
and image checks total only around 4,600 lines. We keep that code clear, with
few dependencies and a simple build process.

Inspired by SeedSigner's stateless approach and descriptor-based hardware-wallet
designs, including Ledger, BitBox02 and Jade. Bitcoin Core provides key
derivation, descriptor handling and transaction signing.

**Status: Under active development. Use at your own risk.** The signer is usable
with [Sparrow](#use-with-sparrow), [Keeper](#use-with-keeper) and [our Liana fork](#use-with-liana).
See [implementation status](docs/STATUS.md) for completed checks and remaining work.

## Download and boot

**[Download the USB image (64 MiB)](https://github.com/bitcoinerlab/thunderden/releases/download/v0.0.1-preview.6/thunderden.img)**
· [SHA-256 checksum](https://github.com/bitcoinerlab/thunderden/releases/download/v0.0.1-preview.6/thunderden.img.sha256)
· [Preview release notes and file inventory](https://github.com/bitcoinerlab/thunderden/releases/tag/v0.0.1-preview.6)

This image boots x86-64 (Intel/AMD) laptops with BIOS or UEFI. You can prepare the
USB on macOS, Linux or Windows; Apple Silicon Macs can write it but cannot boot it.

1. Download the image and checksum, then [verify the download](docs/BUILD.md#verify-the-image).
2. Open [balenaEtcher](https://etcher.balena.io/): **Flash from file →
   `thunderden.img` → Select target → your USB drive → Flash**.
3. Wait for verification, eject the drive and boot the laptop from USB. Disable
   Secure Boot to boot this unsigned image.

**Flashing erases the selected USB drive.** See the
[build and USB guide](docs/BUILD.md) for more detail or to build your own image.

## Design claims

- Your seed and private keys stay in RAM.
- Thunder Den saves no wallet state between boots.
- Thunder Den does not write to the boot USB or the laptop's disks.
- The running signer cannot access disk storage, Ethernet, Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.
- Wallet data and transactions move through QR codes.
- You review and approve transactions on the laptop before signing.
- Wallet requests arrive through QR codes; recovery input and approval use the
  laptop's keyboard. Inputs are treated as untrusted and validated.
- The scanner runs separately from the keys and approval controls. Linux restricts
  its file and process access, and the running programs cannot overwrite the
  installed application files. See [scanner isolation](docs/ISOLATION.md).
- You can build the USB image from pinned sources. Recorded clean-build comparisons
  produced matching SHA-256 hashes; see [build verification](docs/STATUS.md#verified-image-behavior).

## Features

- English BIP39 recovery words with an optional printable ASCII passphrase.
- Chinese (Simplified) BIP39 recovery words entered with pinyin; keys derive from
  the equivalent English phrase.
- Descriptor-based wallets, including SegWit and Taproot Miniscript.
- BIP-388 wallet policies with seed-bound registration proofs.
- BIP44, BIP49, BIP84 and BIP86 defaults without prior registration.
- Partial signing when other signatures or spending conditions are still needed.
- UR v2 scanning and animated QR output, with the scanner isolated from keys
  and approval.
- One USB image for x86-64 laptops with legacy BIOS or UEFI.
- A Docker/Compose build using pinned Linux containers with native build tools.

## Use with Sparrow

[Sparrow](https://sparrowwallet.com/) exchanges QR codes directly with Thunder Den
for single-signature and sorted-multisig wallets. In Sparrow, choose
**Airgapped Hardware Wallet → SeedSigner** for Thunder Den's keystore.

Share the public key, create the wallet in Sparrow, then scan its transaction QR
on Thunder Den. Multisig setup can be approved directly from a complete PSBT.
The preview 5 image was user-tested with Sparrow multisig on a real device. See the
[Sparrow guide](docs/SPARROW.md) for the steps and validation scope.

## Use with Keeper

In [Bitcoin Keeper](https://bitcoinkeeper.app/), select **Jade → QR** for Thunder Den.
Its standard account QR imports through that profile. For multisig signing, scan
Keeper's PSBT first; when Thunder Den requests wallet setup, tap **Vault details**
on Keeper's signing screen and scan its registration QR. Review and approve with
`REGISTER`, then continue to transaction review and `SIGN`.

Preview 6 also lets you scan that registration QR directly from Thunder Den's main
menu. After approval, **Loaded wallet** appears for the session. The inline flow
was user-tested on iOS/testnet4. See the [Keeper guide](docs/KEEPER.md) for the steps,
supported formats and validation scope.

## Use with Liana

Thunder Den is currently usable with [our Liana fork](https://github.com/bitcoinerlab/wizardsardine-liana).
The integration has **not yet been submitted to upstream Liana**.

Build and run the GUI from that fork using its
[build instructions](https://github.com/bitcoinerlab/wizardsardine-liana/blob/master/doc/BUILD.md#building-the-project).
The integration has been built and tested with Rust 1.88. Choose **Bitcoin Core
or Electrum** as the wallet backend. Thunder Den support for Liana Connect is
disabled until its server supports Thunder Den registration tokens.

On the same computer as Liana, start the [QR bridge](https://github.com/bitcoinerlab/thunderden-qr-bridge)
with Node.js 22 or later:

```sh
npx @bitcoinerlab/thunderden-qr-bridge
```

Choose the same Bitcoin network in Thunder Den and Liana, then open Liana's
hardware-wallet selection and follow the instructions on the bridge's browser page.

## What you trust

Thunder Den relies on your hardware and firmware, your build computer and pinned
dependencies. We use widely scrutinized projects such as Bitcoin Core and Linux,
and disable Linux features the signer does not need. Reviewing Thunder Den's code
still leaves those dependencies and your hardware to review or trust.

You can ask an AI coding assistant to inspect this repository for bugs,
vulnerabilities or backdoors. Start with the
[source-reading map](docs/DESIGN.md#build-and-independent-review) and
[dependency inventory](docs/DEPENDENCIES.md). Check its findings against the code
and tests; AI review alone is not proof of security. Report findings in an issue
or submit a focused pull request.

### Limits

Firmware behavior and physical attacks on memory are outside the software's
guarantees. RAM-only operation means no persistent wallet storage, not a promise
that every trace in physical memory becomes unrecoverable at power-off.

To build your own USB image, follow the [build and test instructions](docs/BUILD.md).

Tests and development tools run on the build computer. They are not part of the
production image. Wallet applications can use the standard PSBT QR format or
implement Thunder Den's QR commands. No particular software wallet defines
Thunder Den's design.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome: bug fixes, review findings, documentation and build or
hardware test reports are especially useful. **Simplicity and auditability take
priority over feature count.** Changes must justify their complexity, dependencies
and attack surface; security additions and refactors need a concrete rationale.
See the short [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening a pull request.

## Acknowledgments
